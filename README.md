# Irredundant Bases

This is the [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) code accompanying Peiran Wu's PhD thesis "Irredundant bases for finite almost simple groups".

The main result formalised is `mlii_eq_of_subsingleton_fixedPoints_stabilizer` in [WreathProduct.lean](IrredundantBases/WreathProduct.lean).

- Definitions and lemmas relating to irredundancy and the maximum irredundant base size is in [Basic.lean](IrredundantBases/Basic.lean).
- Definitions and lemmas relating to the product action of a direct product of two monoids or groups is in [Prod.lean](IrredundantBases/Prod.lean).
- Definitions and lemmas relating to the product action of a direct product of monoids or groups is in [Pi.lean](IrredundantBases/Pi.lean).
- Definitions and lemmas relating to the wreath product and its product action is in [WreathProduct.lean](IrredundantBases/WreathProduct.lean).
